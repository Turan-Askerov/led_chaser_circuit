## Installation

1. LEDs are mounted on copper wire (1.5 mm - 2 mm)
2. Make connections according to the circuit diagram
3. Connect the power supply
4. Check that the LEDs flash sequentially

# Dual-Mode LED Chaser Circuit  
## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- **Mode 1**: All LEDs light up simultaneously.  
- **Mode 2**: Sequential chasing pattern.  
- **Control**: Toggle modes with an SPDT switch.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals  
- Learn circuit design and transistor switching.  
- Create a customizable lighting system.  

## Adjustments

- Adjust the potentiometer values to change the flashing speed Change (On 555 timer)
- You can create new effects by trying different LED patterns
