# Dual-Mode LED Chaser Circuit 

This project is an electronic circuit that creates an aesthetically pleasing display by flashing LEDs sequentially.

## 📌 Features

- Multi-LED animation effect
- Adjustable flashing speed
- Low power consumption
- Simple and intuitive circuit design

- **Mode 1**: All LEDs light up simultaneously.  
- **Mode 2**: Sequential chasing pattern.  
- **Control**: Toggle modes with an SPDT switch.  

## 🔧 Materials Used

- 100μF capacitors (5V and 25V)
- 555 Timer IC (or similar oscillator)
- CD4017 Decade Counter (or similar counter)
- Multiple LEDs (can be different colors)
- Resistors
- Cardboard
- USB (5V) power supply
- SPDT switch

## Installation

1. LEDs are mounted on copper wire (1.5 mm - 2 mm)
2. Make connections according to the circuit diagram
3. Connect the power supply
4. Check that the LEDs flash sequentially


## 🎯 Project Goals  
- Learn circuit design and transistor switching.  
- Create a customizable lighting system.  

## Adjustments

- Adjust the potentiometer values to change the flashing speed Change (On 555 timer)
- You can create new effects by trying different LED patterns
